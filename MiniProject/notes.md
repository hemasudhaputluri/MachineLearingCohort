Sure, let's break down the code line by line and explain the theoretical aspects:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

1. **Imports**: 
   - `pandas`: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate numerical tables and time series.
   - `numpy`: It's a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot`: This is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits.
   - `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`: This function is used to split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets. It's typically used for splitting your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`: This is a class for performing linear regression. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
   - `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics`: This function computes the mean squared error regression loss between the true and predicted values.

```python
# Load the dataset from CSV
df = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')
```

2. **Load Data**: 
   - This line reads the dataset from the "house_prices.csv" file into a DataFrame (`df`). A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
   
```python
# Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df[['Size (sq ft)']].values
y = df['Price ($)'].values
```

3. **Data Preparation**: 
   - This part extracts the feature (independent variable) and target variable (dependent variable) from the DataFrame. `X` contains the features (size of the house) while `y` contains the target variable (house prices). The `.values` attribute converts the DataFrame columns into NumPy arrays, which are easier to work with in machine learning algorithms.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

4. **Train/Test Split**: 
   - This line splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. The `test_size` parameter determines the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split (in this case, 20%). The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed for data shuffling.

```python
# Train the linear regression model
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

5. **Model Training**: 
   - Here, a linear regression model is instantiated using `LinearRegression()` and trained using the `fit` method with the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`). The model learns the relationship between the size of the house and its price during this training phase.

```python
# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = lin_reg.predict(X_test)
```

6. **Prediction**: 
   - This line makes predictions on the test data (`X_test`) using the trained linear regression model. The `predict` method estimates the house prices based on the size of the houses.

```python
# Calculate mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

7. **Evaluation**: 
   - The mean squared error (MSE) between the true house prices (`y_test`) and the predicted house prices (`y_pred`) is calculated using the `mean_squared_error` function. MSE measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Lower values of MSE indicate better model performance.

```python
# Plot the data and the linear regression line
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red')
plt.title('House Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Size (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.show()
```

8. **Visualization**: 
   - This part visualizes the results by plotting the test data points (`X_test`, `y_test`) as blue dots and the predicted regression line (`X_test`, `y_pred`) as a red line. The plot helps visualize how well the linear regression model fits the data and predicts house prices based on their size.
